        <h3>Computer Vision</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Information-theoretic Visual Segmentation &amp; Lexical Learning</strong>:
          my undergraduate thesis for Commonwealth College and computer science
          honors, being completed under Professor Learned-Miller in the computer
          vision lab. I am exploring visual structure as a compression problem
          and how to learn visual codes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The essence of this project is information theory-driven unsupervised
          learning of structure. Specifically, this capstone will address the
          problem of visual segmentation: deriving a set of distinct objects and
          regions and their locations from images. Consider a child drawing in
          scenes from a coloring book. The world is such a book without any of
          the lines. This is the visual segmentation problem: to identify
          meaningful parts of the world from the chaos of visual impressions.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Character Alignment for Scene Text Understanding</strong>:
          the word spotting task is the problem of recognizing instances of
          known text in the real world, such as recognizing street signs or
          business posters. I worked with PhD student Jacqueline Feild on the
          character alignment and similarity-scoring portion of a scene text
          recognition system for this purpose. I implemented alignment via a new
          probabilistic image representation developed by Professor
          Learned-Miller, the
          <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~elm/papers_by_research.html">distribution field</a>.
          I am 2<sup>nd</sup> author on a paper submitted to CVPR 2012 about
          this system and its improvement of state-of-the-art performance on a
          widely-used data set.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>F3DB</strong>: I was responsible for data collection
          for this in-progress data set for 3D pose estimation of faces (the
          successor to the FDDB standard in face detection). I designed, implemented
          and assessed a large scale facial pose annotation system on Mechanical Turk
          with the feedback of (now graduated) PhD student Vidit Jain and
          Professor Learned-Miller. This system included a statistical quality
          assurance check to automatically accept and reject annotations.

        <h3>Psychology</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/shelhamer/toj-apparatus">
            Time Order Judgement Apparatus
          </a>: a novel device for biophysics experiments concerning time
          order judgements–the perceived order of observed events. I designed,
          assembled, and programmed the apparatus after discussing the need for
          it with neuroscience and behavior &amp; cognitive psychology PhD
          student Patrick Taylor. It is currently in use as a covariate in
          studies of the precedence effect in psychoacoustics and other
          cognitive psychology research in the NeuroCognition and Perception
          lab.

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/shelhamer/umass-psych-math-cheat-task">
            Math Cheating Task
          </a>: this application was developed to study self-deceptive cheating
          for social psychology PhD student Mindi Rock. The app presents
          subjects with a series of arithmetic questions and the subject may
          cheat by pressing a button. This is explained as a bug leftover from
          testing.
